Just my personal ``.bashrc``

to use it just copy the content to your ``.bashrc``
or have some other file like ``.mybashrc`` and source it in ``.bashrc``:
```
source .mybashrc 
```

I the meanwhile I added a .zshrc since I use zsh instead of bash on my mac.


As it stands the .bashrc assumes some utilities to be installed, like git, gitcompletion tree or fzf.
If you don't have them installed I heavly recommend having a look at them.
