Just my personal ``.bashrc``

to use it just copy the content to your ``.bashrc``
or have some other file like ``.mybashrc`` and source it in ``.bashrc``:
```
source .mybashrc 
```

As it stands the .bashrc assumes some utilities to be installed, like git, tree or fzf.
If you don't have them installed I heavly recommend having a look at them.
